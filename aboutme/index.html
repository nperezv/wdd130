    <h2>Nelson</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! my name is Nelson Perez, Im form Per√∫ but currently living in Madrid Spain. 
    My family ad I moved to Spain 4 years ago. We were 3 people, My wife, my son and I.
    Now we are 4, another baby boy comes here and he is 1 year-old now. Im so grateful for being a part of this opportunity and experience as a BYU I student.
    One of the hardest trouble I had to face was finding a job here in Spain. It was very hard for me to get a job and that experience made me feel discouraged and with no hope.
    I really faced a hard time in my life until I awake and realize that Heavenly Father was always there. He really was. </p>
    <p>After serving to the Lord for 2 years as a full time missionary, I started BYU Pathways and had completed the middle of the journey.
    So I look for the opportunity to retake that path. I did it and continue without a job jet, but something was diferent, 
    I trusted in the Lord's promisses. The darkness and pain gets off and all was changing. I finished BYU Pathway and get an offer to start  an online degree at BYU I.
    I remember perfectly when I had to decide what career to chose. I was always interested in technology, 
    but never know that programming will be my favorite part and decide to apply for a Software Development Major. </p>
    <p>Some courses and credits earned after the start of this beautiful experience, I recieved my first certificate in Computer Programming, 
    which helped me to find a job and provide for my family. I have no words to describe what I feel whenever I had to talk about this, 
    I just can say it is possible for everyone of us, Because we are children of God and we can do everything if we trust in Him and work hard.   </p>
