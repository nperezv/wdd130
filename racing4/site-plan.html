      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I would like to work on a videogames webpage focused on racing games, such as "Need for Speed", "Burnout Paradise", "Gran Turismo", "Formula1", "Forza Horizon". Also publishing tips and tricks, top 10 racing games and sharing promotional codes to have disccounts at Steam,  EA Play or Xbox.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>There is a great community that asks for this kind of webpages, in fact, 59% of racing players are male (vs. 51% of all gamers) and 25% are age 10-20 (vs. 19% of all gamers). Despite skewing younger, 36% of racing players are high-earners, which is far higher than the average for all gamers.</p>  <!-- change this -->
